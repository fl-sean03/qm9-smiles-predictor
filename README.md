# CHEM555Project: QM9 Property Prediction Workflows

This repository presents four distinct feed-forward neural-network (FNN) pipelines for predicting nine molecular properties from the QM9 dataset. The project explores different featurization strategies and model architectures to compare their performance on this benchmark task.

The four implemented pipelines are:

1.  **Baseline**: A single-task FNN trained directly on Mordred descriptors.
2.  **Multitask**: A shared-encoder FNN utilizing Mordred descriptors for simultaneous prediction of all nine properties.
3.  **Autoencoder**: FNNs trained on latent space embeddings generated by an autoencoder pre-trained on Mordred descriptors.
4.  **Hybrid**: Single-task FNNs trained on a concatenated feature set of ECFP4 fingerprints and Mordred descriptors.

## 🚀 Installation

1.  **Clone** the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fl-sean03/qm9-smiles-predictor.git
    cd qm9-smiles-predictor
    ```
2.  **Set up** a Python 3.9+ virtual environment and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Ensure necessary libraries like `tensorflow`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `rdkit`, and `mordred` are included in `requirements.txt`.)*

3.  **Prepare Data**:
    -   Obtain the raw QM9 dataset (`qm9_clean.csv`) and the extracted targets (`qm9_targets.csv`) and place them in `data/qm9/`.
    -   Generate or obtain the cleaned Mordred descriptors (`mordred_cleaned.csv`) and place it in `data/mordred_features/`.

## 📊 Workflows

Each pipeline has a set of scripts in the `src/` directory to perform featurization (if applicable), training, evaluation, and visualization. The general workflow for each method involves running these scripts sequentially.

Detailed commands for running each workflow can be found within the respective script files in the `src/` subdirectories.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Model hyperparameters and training settings can typically be adjusted via command-line arguments for each script. Refer to the individual script files for specific options.
